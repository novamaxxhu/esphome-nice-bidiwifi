## Supported Hardware

### BiDi-WiFi Module
The [Nice BiDi-WiFi](https://www.niceforyou.com/) module is an ESP32-WROOM-32E board that plugs into the IBT4N connector on Nice control units. This component replaces its factory firmware.

### Tested Control Units
| Controller | Type | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **MC800** | Swing gate | Fully tested and working |
| **CL201** | Swing gate | Tested and working |
| **FILO400** | Sliding gate | Fully tested and working |

Other Nice controllers with IBT4N/BusT4 interface should work (Walky, Robus, Road 400, etc.) with device-specific adaptations built in:
- **Walky (WLA)** — 1-byte position values (auto-detected)
- **Robus (ROB)** — Position polling disabled during movement (auto-detected)
- **Road 400** — Alternate status codes 0x83/0x84 handled

## How position tracking works

The hub layers several mechanisms so the cover and percentage sensors stay useful even when encoders are partial or noisy. The idea matches what other Nice Bus-T4 ESPHome projects document—for example [makstech/esphome-BusT4](https://github.com/makstech/esphome-BusT4)—with behaviour tuned to this codebase.

### 1. Encoder position (primary when fresh)

When the controller returns current/encoder position, it updates the cover and optional encoder sensor. While the gate is **opening** or **closing**, the hub polls encoder/current position on an interval (default **500 ms**, configurable with **`position_report_interval`** on the cover; values are clamped between 50 ms and 60 s).

Encoder-derived position is preferred only when a reading arrived within the last **2 seconds**; if it is older, time-based estimation may be used instead.

**Robus** units are detected from the product name; for those, position is **not** polled during movement because the drive does not handle it reliably.

**Walky** controllers use **1-byte** position values; most others use two-byte values (and some use a three-byte layout).

### 2. Time-based estimation (fallback)

If encoder data is unavailable or stale during a move, position is estimated from elapsed time and **learned** open/close durations:

- Durations are captured on **complete** movements (e.g. fully closed → fully open) and **persisted** across reboots when **`auto_learn_timing`** is true (default). With **`auto_learn_timing: false`**, flash is not updated and **`open_duration`** / **`close_duration`** in YAML define the timings used for time-based estimation.
- Before the first successful learn (or when a direction has no stored value yet), **`open_duration`** and **`close_duration`** act as fallbacks (defaults **20 s** each, same idea as [esphome-BusT4](https://github.com/makstech/esphome-BusT4)).
- Only durations between about **3 seconds** and **5 minutes** are accepted; interrupted cycles do **not** update stored timings.
- If a new measurement differs from the stored duration by more than about **10%**, the stored value is updated (adaptive re-learning).

### 3. Limit switch confirmation

Diagnostic **I/O** (`REG_DIAG_IO`) is read after relevant status changes. Limit-switch bits are used to snap position to **fully open** or **fully closed** when the automation status matches (`STA_OPENED` / `STA_CLOSED`), which corrects small drift in the time-based estimate.

### 4. Periodic status refresh

Roughly every **15 seconds** the hub requests **status** again (and maneuver count, using `REG_TOTAL_COUNT` or `REG_NUM_MOVEMENTS` depending on the controller). That recovers from missed packets and picks up changes from remotes or the panel.

## Hardware Setup

### Pin Mapping (BiDi-WiFi Module)

| Function | GPIO | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| T4 Bus RX | 18 | Direct connection to T4 bus (BAT54A protection) |
| T4 Bus TX | 21 | Via BC847 open-collector driver |
| LED1 Red | 25 | Gate status (active-low) |
| LED1 Green | 2 | Gate status (active-low, strapping pin) |
| LED2 Red | 27 | Bus connectivity (active-low) |
| LED2 Green | 26 | Bus connectivity (active-low) |
| LED3 | 22 | Overall status (active-low) |
| Reset Button | 5 | — |

### Wiring

Connect a USB-UART adapter (3.3V) to the BiDi-WiFi module:

| Adapter | Module | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| TX | RX (GPIO 3 / RXD0) | |
| RX | TX (GPIO 1 / TXD0) | |
| GND | GND | |
| 3.3V | 3.3V | Do NOT use 5V |
| RTS | EN | Auto-reset (optional) |
| DTR | GPIO 0 | Auto-boot mode (optional) |

### Backup Factory Firmware

**Always backup the original firmware before flashing!** This allows you to restore the Nice factory firmware if needed.

```bash
esptool.py --port COMx --baud 921600 read_flash 0x0 0x800000 bidiwifi-factory-backup.bin
```

This reads the full 8MB flash (bootloader, partitions, app, NVS, SPIFFS). Store the backup safely.

To restore the factory firmware later:
```bash
esptool.py --port COMx --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 bidiwifi-factory-backup.bin
```

### Flashing

1. **Remove** the BiDi-WiFi module from the gate control unit
2. **Connect** the USB-UART adapter as described above
3. **Enter flash mode:**
   - If your adapter has RTS/DTR connected, `esptool` handles this automatically
   - If not, manually: short **GPIO 0 to GND**, then briefly short **EN to GND** to reset, then release GPIO 0
4. **Flash**: `esphome run nice-bidiwifi-gate.yaml --device COMx`
5. **Reinstall** the module into the control unit's IBT4N connector

After the first flash, subsequent updates can be done via OTA (wireless).

### Cover platform options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `auto_learn_timing` | `true` | Learn open/close duration from completed moves and persist to flash. If `false`, YAML `open_duration` / `close_duration` are used and preferences are not updated from the bus. |
| `open_duration` | `20s` | Initial/fallback duration for time-based position (clamped to the same 3 s–5 min band as learning). |
| `close_duration` | `20s` | Same for closing. |
| `position_report_interval` | `500ms` | How often to request encoder/current position while the gate is moving (hub clamps to 50 ms–60 s). |
| `invert_open_close` | `false` | Swap open/close commands and reported position when the physical install is reversed. |
| `supports_position` | `true` | Expose a position slider in Home Assistant; set `false` if the encoder is unusable and you rely on open/closed state only. |

### Available Button Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sbs` | Step by Step (toggle) |
| `open` | Open |
| `close` | Close |
| `stop` | Stop |
| `partial_open_1` | Partial open position 1 |
| `partial_open_2` | Partial open position 2 |
| `partial_open_3` | Partial open position 3 |
| `lock` | Lock gate |
| `unlock` | Unlock gate |
| `light_toggle` | Toggle courtesy light |
| `open_and_lock` | Open then lock |
| `close_and_lock` | Close then lock |

### Configuration Options

```yaml
nice_bidiwifi:
  uart_rx_pin: 18          # T4 bus RX (default: 18)
  uart_tx_pin: 21          # T4 bus TX (default: 21)
  hub_address: 0x5090      # Hub address (default: 0x5090)
  led1_red_pin: 25         # LED1 red (default: 25)
  led1_green_pin: 2        # LED1 green (default: 2)
  led2_red_pin: 27         # LED2 red (default: 27)
  led2_green_pin: 26       # LED2 green (default: 26)
  led3_pin: 22             # LED3 (default: 22)
```

### Number ranges (force, speed, pause, …)

Opening/closing **force** (`0x4A` / `0x4B`) and **speed** (`0x42` / `0x43`) are exposed as **1–100** with unit **%**, which matches the usual Nice Bus-T4 / DMP convention on many controllers. **This repo does not embed model-specific tables** (e.g. CL201): your drive may accept the full range, clamp silently, or **NACK** (`0xFD`) if a value is illegal. For authoritative limits, use the **official Nice programming/installation guide for your board**.

If you need to try values outside the number entities, or to replay a capture from logs, use **`send_raw_cmd`** on the hub (see below).

### Debugging: raw hex on the bus

The hub exposes **`send_raw_cmd(std::string)`**, same idea as [makstech/esphome-BusT4](https://github.com/makstech/esphome-BusT4): pass a hex string (`"55.0C.00.FF..."` or `"550C00FF..."`; spaces, dots, colons, and newlines are ignored). An **odd** digit count or invalid characters are rejected (nothing is sent).

Use a **template `text`** entity in Home Assistant and call **`id(<your_hub_id>).send_raw_cmd(x)`** (the hub id from `nice_bidiwifi:`, not the cover id). Put **`text:` at the root of the YAML** (same indentation as `esphome:`, `number:`, `wifi:`). If `text:` is indented under the `number:` block, the file will fail to parse with an error near that line.

Example:

```yaml
text:
  - platform: template
    name: "Raw T4 hex"
    id: raw_t4_hex
    optimistic: true
    mode: text
    on_value:
      then:
        - lambda: |-
            if (!x.empty()) {
              id(my_gate).send_raw_cmd(x);
            }
```

## T4 Bus Protocol

The Nice T4 bus protocol operates at 19200 baud 8N1 with UART break signaling:

- **Break**: ~520us low pulse before each packet (generated via baud rate switching)
- **Packet**: `[0x00][0x55][size][to:2][from:2][msg_type][msg_size][crc1][message...][crc2][size]`
- **CRC**: XOR-based (CRC1 for header, CRC2 for message body)
- **Protocols**: DEP (direct commands) and DMP (register read/write)
- **Hub address**: 0x5090 (default for BiDi-WiFi hardware)

### Architecture

```
Home Assistant ←→ ESPHome (ESP32) ←→ T4 Bus ←→ Nice Control Unit (MC800)
                   WiFi/API            UART         Gate Motor
```

The component uses a hub+platform pattern (similar to `modbus_controller`):
- **Hub** (`nice_bidiwifi`) — T4 bus driver, device discovery, packet parsing
- **Platforms** — Cover, Button, Switch, Number, Sensor, Text Sensor, Binary Sensor
